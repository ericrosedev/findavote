# Current setup instructions

FindaVote is a no-code tooling first project, we are experimenting with building an app with no-code tools, specifically Caffeine.ai.

We expect most of our team to have access to Caffeine.ai during WCHL25 as the rollout continues, and will update our setup instructions as more information becomes available.

For now, team members with Caffiene.ai accounts can ask it to look at this repo (https://github.com/ericrosedev/findavote) and pull/clone the codebase.

If the Caffeine.ai app store is launched during WCHL25, team members will be able to "clone" the app, as well as pull updates to the codebase from other members.

We will provide manual installation instructions for WCHL25 judges, staff, and team members who do not have access to Caffeine.ai ASAP.
